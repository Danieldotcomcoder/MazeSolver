# MazeSolver

## Description
This is a Python project that generates and solves mazes. It uses recursive backtrack algorithm to create a maze. 
The maze can be solved using three algorithms:

- Breadth First Search
- Depth first Search
- A Search algorithm

You can visualize how the algorithm is working in real time too.
